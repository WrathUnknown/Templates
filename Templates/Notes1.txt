include an Empathy map?

Research prexisting app/web or other areas as examples access them using SWOT or benefits and disadvantages:

- Express how this could be fixed and what other things can be done in order to reach requirements.

WHAT TASK 1A SHOULD INCLUDE:
---
The proposal: Fully identify problems to be solved:
- Effectively decompose all of the problems identified.

The proposed solution would effectively:
- meet the full needs of the client and user.
- mitigating all of the potential risks.
- addressing all of the relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements in relation to software development and the industry.

The proposal provides:

- comprehensive lines of reasoning that justify:
1. the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and users.
2. proposed solution will address relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements in relation to software development and the industry.
3. Fully link risks and how they will be mitigated and how your solution will address relevant guidelines and requirements. Mention research, linking to the appendix and it will showcase a comprehensive reasoning.

The proposal provides comprehensive and perceptive definitions of:

- functional and non-functional requirements.
- key performance indicators (code churn, other KPIs measuring profit margin, client retention rate and customer satisfaction)
- User acceptance criteria (should be a table that includes user requirements and acceptance criteria)
---

THE PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE THESE THINGS!!!:

- Intro page (use word template)

- Table of contents

- Overview

- Business context (create table including stakeholders, relation and desired outcome) it should include the customer, client and developers normally, just add additional rows if there is more stakeholders. A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a company and can either affect or be affected by business.

- C4 model or any other designs such as flowcharts and pseudocode (will be used in the design document most likely) C4 model includes 4 levels: Context, Container, Component and class, they should include explainations.

- Contraints internal/external (include a table with the constraint, impact of constraint and management of constraint basically how it will be dealt with.

The internal contraints included being: cost, scope, time, quality and resources for internal contraints 

External constraints included being: legislative, security, localisation and risks

- User environment and experience

- Deployment

- Functional and non-functional requirements (include a table with the ID, requirement, mandatory and priority. The requirements are depdendent on the scenario. 

Include a description for each of the requirements, will show a better reasoning.

- KPIs and user acceptance criteria (describe the KPIs and their uses relevant to the project first before adding the acceptance criteria)

Include a table for user acceptance criteria adding the user requirement and acceptance criteria.

- Justification (justify all aspects metioned upon as well as the appendix if applicable)
