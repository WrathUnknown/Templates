TASK 1B SHOULD INCLUDE:

- Intro (logo, client name etc)

- Gantt chart (use template in excel, color code tasks, set time scale, devs etc)

- C4 model (include the key and the 4 levels such as context, container, component and code)

Explain each level of the model for non-technical users

- Include flowcharts and pseudocode for technical users

- Proposed design interface (a mockup of how the system will look/function and explaination for each aspect).

- Common contentions

- Database example if needed.

- Algorithms such as interval search or binary search tree.

- data requirements for the proposed solution such as a variables table (include var name and function)

- data structures (design)

- data types

- components that should be tested - order

- types of tests required

include principles and types as an explaination

then include the ones required
---

Designs/work to be included!!!:
---
Drivers relationship map - Explain the goals of the digital solution (around 4-5 paragraphs)
Gantt chart - include the tasks and dates as well as a description.
C4 model (possibly swap this in Task 1A), add descriptions for each level.
Proposed design interface - add descriptions for each design window, must include layout, white space and other common conventions.
Pseudocode, flowcharts etc.
Common conventions (to follow).
Database table (links to interval search/binary tree algorithm).
Data requirements (variable table).
Data structure (data types).
Components to be tested - order.
Type of tests required - principles, types, required.
Target code churn KPI by date - explain what the design is and is measured.
Cumulative Flow KPI - include description
Defect Density KPI - include description
sprint burndown - include description
Proposed timeline and milestones - explain after designs
data dictionary
Visual/interface design
Algorithm designs (data flow diagram, flowchart)
The test strategy

Overview - what to include in Task 1 B:

Proposed design interface - include layout and white space, visual hierarchies and common conventions.

use site navigation charts and wireframes of additional pages to show a full understanding.
---

Effective decomposition of identified problems that comprehensively cover: inputs, processes and outputs.

Include handling user access (setting up account, logging-in, changing password)
- Collection and processing of data, user data such (search???)
- Automatic data collection vs manual user input
- Communication/data exchange between different platforms or between front-end and back-end systems
- Key calculations.
- Data filtering and visualization.
---

Algorithms to produce consistently correct outcomes as a result of: precise logic, efficient structure and sequence and use of accepted conventions.

- Think about flowcharts, pseudocode to show different outcomes within the system.
---

Data requirements for the proposed solution such as: variables, data structures and data types.
- Consistent naming and conventions used throughout.
- Effective error handling procedures are identified for the inputs/processed that require them.

Add data dictionaries!!! Will highlight the data stored: the type, length and any validation rules required.
---

Test strategy to demonstrate an understanding of: how components interrelate.
- The order in which components should be tested.
- The types of tests that are required.

The template test plan needs to be implemented!!!
---

Communication of the design as a result of: the use of appropriate techniques, methods and formats.
- The use of technical language that is appropriate for the intended audience.

Add descriptions for designs throughout task 1B !!!
